# Creating pipline using Pycaret3
## Overview

1. ### The pipeline uses Pycaret3 to create a machine learning model to predict the species of an iris flower based on its characteristics.

2. ### The pipeline loads the iris dataset from Pycaret3's built-in datasets and sets the target variable as 'species'.

3. ### The pipeline uses Pycaret3's setup() function to preprocess the data and set up the machine learning pipeline.

4. ### The pipeline creates a Random Forest model using Pycaret3's create_model() function.

5. ### The pipeline evaluates the model using Pycaret3's plot_model() function to visualize the confusion matrix.

6. ### The pipeline deploys the model using Pycaret3's deploy_model() function, making it available for predictions through an API endpoint.

## Scope 

1. ### The scope of this pipeline is to demonstrate how Pycaret3 can be used to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline with minimal coding effort.
2. ### Pycaret3 automates the machine learning pipeline, making it easier and faster to build and deploy machine learning models.
3. ### Pycaret3 can be used for a wide range of machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, and anomaly detection.
4. ### This pipeline demonstrates how easy and fast it is to create a machine learning model using Pycaret3. By automating the end-to-end machine learning process, Pycaret3 enables data scientists and machine learning practitioners to focus on high-level tasks such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection.


## Data

### For this Project, we will use the classic Iris dataset, which contains information about the physical characteristics of different types of iris flowers.

### We loaded the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame.

## Steps

1. ### Import libraries and load dataset: The first step is to import the necessary libraries and load the Iris dataset using Pycaret3's built-in get_data() function.

2. ### Setup the pipeline: The next step is to set up the machine learning pipeline using Pycaret3's setup() function. We specify the target variable as 'species' to indicate that we want to predict the species of the iris flower.

3. ### Create a model: We then create a logistic regression model using Pycaret3's create_model() function. We specify 'lr' as the algorithm parameter to indicate that we want to use logistic regression.

4. ### Evaluate the model: We use Pycaret3's plot_model() function to evaluate the performance of the model. This function generates several plots, including a confusion matrix, which helps us assess the model's accuracy.

5. ### Deploy the model: Finally, we deploy the model using Pycaret3's deploy_model() function. This function allows us to serve the model through an API endpoint, making it available for predictions.

## Visualization
### I created several visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib, including a histogram of the sepal length by class, a scatterplot of the sepal length and petal length colored by class

## Technologies Used
 
  .Matlotlib
  
  .Seaborn
## Steps
### 1.I define a function called data_analysis

This function takes a pandas dataframe as input and performs the following operations:

. Checks for missing values using Pandas isnull function data_analysis.py , and drops them using dropna function if there are any.

. Checks for duplicate rows using Pandas duplicated function, and drops them using drop_duplicates function if there are any.

. Calculates the mean, mode, median, and standard deviation using Pandas mean, mode, median, and std functions, respectively.

. Prints the calculated statistics.

. Returns the cleaned dataframe.

### 2.Then i used read_csv function from Pandas to load it into a DataFrame

### 3.Then I called the data_analysis function to perform some data cleaning and analysis

### 4.Then i created  some visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
