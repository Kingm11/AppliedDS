# Creating pipline using Pycaret3
## Overview
### The pipeline uses Pycaret3 to create a machine learning model to predict the species of an iris flower based on its characteristics.

### The pipeline loads the iris dataset from Pycaret3's built-in datasets and sets the target variable as 'species'.

### The pipeline uses Pycaret3's setup() function to preprocess the data and set up the machine learning pipeline.
### The pipeline creates a Random Forest model using Pycaret3's create_model() function.

### The pipeline evaluates the model using Pycaret3's plot_model() function to visualize the confusion matrix.

### The pipeline deploys the model using Pycaret3's deploy_model() function, making it available for predictions through an API endpoint.

## Data
### I imported the data ' Iris dataset' from a URL using Pandas' read_csv function , and then clean the data by removing any rows with missing or invalid values, and remove any duplicate rows.

## Visualization
### I created several visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib, including a histogram of the sepal length by class, a scatterplot of the sepal length and petal length colored by class

## Technologies Used
 
  .Matlotlib
  
  .Seaborn
## Steps
### 1.I define a function called data_analysis

This function takes a pandas dataframe as input and performs the following operations:

. Checks for missing values using Pandas isnull function data_analysis.py , and drops them using dropna function if there are any.

. Checks for duplicate rows using Pandas duplicated function, and drops them using drop_duplicates function if there are any.

. Calculates the mean, mode, median, and standard deviation using Pandas mean, mode, median, and std functions, respectively.

. Prints the calculated statistics.

. Returns the cleaned dataframe.

### 2.Then i used read_csv function from Pandas to load it into a DataFrame

### 3.Then I called the data_analysis function to perform some data cleaning and analysis

### 4.Then i created  some visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
